## The role of the administrator

For any organization wishing to use MIQA to augment their workflow, an individual or group of individuals must take on the responsibility of managing the organization’s MIQA instance. The administrator(s) will need some experience with using a server command line and must be prepared to upkeep the site, database, and users. This guide is intended to offer advice to administrators as they create and manage an instance of MIQA for their organization.

### Superuser privileges

The administrator will have a superuser account in their MIQA instance in order to accomplish this setup. This means that they will have unrestricted access to the system and database. As a result, care should be taken in the selection of administrators. They will be able to see and edit all projects, experiments, scans, etc. in MIQA; project access control does not apply to them.
